# 2022-09-26 GraphBLAS C API Committee

Attendees:
  - Erik Welch
  - Jim Kitchen
  - Manoj Kumar

## Feedback from HPEC BoF

- "What GraphBLAS got wrong" is probably too high-level for us to worry about currently.


## GrB_Wait Improvements

[Erik] In non-blocking mode, we need a way to declare which objects will be waited and which are intermediate results. The current API makes it hard to do fusion because the library doesn't know when intermediate variables are no longer needed.

[Jim] Think of it like a function scope. At the end of the function, you return one or more objects and all other variables go out of scope. Having something with that same flavor would make fusion easier, I think.

## Type Introspection

Where do we stand?

#### Erik
- Need agreement on who owns the string, what is a valid string, fixed size or null terminated (recommend: null terminated, copy)
- Serialize/deserialize is currently wrong
- Mechanism to pass in various attributes (recommend: Will Kimmerer proposal, variadic)

#### Manoj
- If we allow various attributes, we should use JSON because it is easy to manage
- We should have some standard keys and values that algorithm implementers can expect (i.e. standardization helps)

## Action Items

- [Erik] Update the proposal from 8/8; make it as concise and concrete as possible so we can come to an agreement and present to Tim D. soon
