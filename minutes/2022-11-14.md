## Generic set/get proposal

- Will presented his first cut at proper spec language for his proposal
- We discussed various aspects of the proposal and came to some tentative agreements
    - Allow 5 different return types (void, GrB_Scalar, GrB_Type, GrB_Monoid, GrB_BinaryOp)
    - Not all objects will support all return types
    - Implementations should accept input hints, but can ignore them
    - If an implementation doesn't support a field (ex. no ability to set a Matrix's name), it should return NO_VALUE on a `get`.



## Action Items

- [Will] Finish up spec language for proposal
