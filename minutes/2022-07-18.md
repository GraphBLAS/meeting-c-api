Attendees:
  - Tim Mattson
  - Erik Welch
  - Jim Kitchen
  - Will Kimmerer

## C Spec github repo

https://github.com/GraphBLAS/graphblas-api-c

- [ ] **Task** (_Tim Mattson_): add members of this call as admins

- [ ] **Task**: decide on folders vs branches

- [ ] **Task**: how to communicate and discuss issues? email or GitHub issues/discussions?

  - Erik likes discussions in the open, unless conflict/tricky issues, which might be better over email

## Future High Level Goals of GraphBLAS

Write once, run anywhere efficiently

Tim has a goal to take an algorithm written in python-graphblas, feed it into a toolchain which writes DSL code that can be lowered to any hardware with code as efficient as any human could write.

## Role of the Committee

From Tim Mattson:

C and C++ Spec committees operate in tandem for GraphBLAS as a whole.
C++ committee will take on the distributed story -- dramatically easier in C++ than in C.

- [ ] **Task**: create a new math spec which the C/C++ specs can reference

This is a more urgent need for C++ committee to avoid duplicating words. The common pieces should be pulled out into the math spec to avoid repeating them in the C++ spec.

Later, the C spec can also remove those math bits.

## Next Agenda

- Type Introspection Proposal(s)
