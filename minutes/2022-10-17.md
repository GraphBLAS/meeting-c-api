# 2022-10-17 GraphBLAS C API Committee

Attendees:
  - Erik Welch
  - Manoj Kumar
  - Jim Kitchen
  - Will Kimmerer

## Generic set/get proposal

- Will presented his proposal in greater detail
- Decisions were made (see his notes)
- Concensus was reached to make `Type_set` with `GrB_Name` invalid in 2.1 and instead create a `Type_new_v3()` method
    - Any type created using the old `Type_new()` would have an UNKNOWN name and can only be deserialized with the old deserialize method
    - A type created with a proper name will have that name serialized and can then be deserialized with a new `_v3` method that doesn't require the type to be passed in
    - 

## Action Items

- [Jim] Full proposal for type introspection for 2.1 and 3.0
- [All] Look at the [existing issues](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/graphblas-api-c/issues) BB-4 thru BB-29 in-depth so we can actually discuss them during the weekly meeting
- [Will] Write up the improved get/set proposal for further discussion
